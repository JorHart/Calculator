A recreation of a GUI based calculator. The purpose is to help learn and build skills. This project uses C#, the .NET library, and Windows Form App API using the Visual Studio 2022 IDE.
In it's current form the calculator only takes in two numbers and either adds, subtracts, multiplies, or divides.
